				<p>"Mark greatly assisted me as an expert witness in a dispute related to the issuance and purchase of securities. He is very knowledgeable in the law and regulations related to such matters, quickly identified and smartly addressed the key issues, and was very responsive and a pleasure to work with. I would not hesitate to consult with Mark again."</p>

					<p>"Our client, through our firm, retained Professor Mark Lee to perform a detailed and thorough analysis of equity issues that was required to make a full and thorough assessment of litigation risk and strategy.  Professor Lee served as the ideal expert–he was efficient, professional and performed his work with the highest of integrity.  When his analysis was complete, he provided a detailed report that our client used to make truly integral business decisions about the litigation at issue. Professor Lee made his knowledge accessible to all with whom he interacted–a skill that is often lost with experts performing complicated analyses."</p>
