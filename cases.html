				<h3>Antitrust Litigation</h3>
				<article>
					<h4>Case 1: Defense of a Park District</h4>
					<img src="images/park.jpg" alt="Children on swings at a park"><!--Photo by cottonbro from Pexels-->
					<p>A park district found itself the target of a $10 million antitrust suit. Efforts to dispose of the suit short of trial proved futile. In fact, these efforts generated judicial opinions strongly suggesting that the park district had committed several antitrust offenses. A renowned antitrust professor advised the lawyers for the park district that it would unquestionably lose the upcoming trial on the merits. The lawyers, experienced litigators, but antitrust neophytes, summoned me to their office. They required (1) an intensive course in antitrust law and its application to their case; (2) a general strategy for trial; and (3) a plan for eleventh hour discovery and investigation that would give them the ammunition that this strategy demanded.</p>
					<p>The Outcome: Judgment for the park district on all counts. The plaintiffs agreed to forego appeal in return for the park district’s agreement to forego antitrust claims against the plaintiffs.</p>

					<h4>Case 2: Medical Malpractice Insurance</h4>
					<img src="images/hospital-beds.jpeg" alt="Inside a hospital room with three beds"><!--Photo by Pixabay from Pexels-->
					<p>A hospital chain revoked the admitted privileges of a physician in good standing because he had declined to purchase malpractice insurance from a carrier favored by the chain. The physician sued claiming that the malpractice carrier had violated Section Two of the Sherman Act and that it had conspired with the hospital chain in violation of Section One. The physician’s lawyers, having never litigated an antitrust claim, failed to establish much of a case by the time discovery had ended. The high-powered lawyers for the insurance carrier and the hospital chain moved not only for summary judgment but for Rule 11 sanctions against the lawyers. With two weeks remaining before the opposition to summary judgment was due, the lawyers engaged me to write it.	</p>
					<p>The Outcome: Summary judgment denied. Request for sanctions denied.</p>

				<h3>Corporate Litigation</h3>

				<h4>Case 1: Advising re: Hostile Takeover</h4>
				<img src="images/bank.png" alt="Front of a bank"><!--Photo provided by Mark R. Lee-->
				<p>The directors of a highly lucrative bank were confronted with unwelcome attentions of an expansion-minded bank holding company. The target bank’s chairman, who was about to retire, had solicited the holding company’s interest with the hope that a takeover would permit him to easily convert his bank stock into cash. Knowing that the other directors were disinclined to sell the bank, he secured an opinion from his personal lawyer that the board was obligated to let the shareholders know of the holding company’s approach. At the urging of the bank’s general counsel, the directors sought my help. I furnished an opinion that not only contradicted the one given by the chairman’s lawyer, but suggested that the board might well be obliged to keep the holding company’s approach confidential due to its preliminary and highly conditional nature. I also advised the board about its response to the holding company’s approach, in particular how to honor its fiduciary duties without encouraging a takeover.</p>
				<p>The Outcome: The chairman gave up his push for disclosure to the shareholders, he and the other directors reached an understanding about his bank stock, and the holding company turned its attention elsewhere.</p>

					<h4>Case 2: Non-Vested Stock Options</h4>
					<img src="images/stock-options.jpg" alt="Pill bottles"><!--Photo by RF._.studio from Pexels-->
					<p>A major pharmaceutical company terminated a high-level executive. Claiming that the termination resulted from national origin discrimination, the executive sought “front pay,” including the value of hoped-for, but-yet-to-be-vested stock options, options he asserted were worth millions. The company’s general counsel engaged me as an expert to rebut the executive’s claims. My report showed that, even if the discrimination could be proven, it was doubtful that the executive was entitled to “front pay,” and it was certain that any such front pay could not include the value of hoped-for, but-yet-to-be-vested stock options.</p>
					<p>The Outcome: The executive settled for pennies on the dollar.</p>

				<h3>Securities Regulation</h3>

					<h4>Case 1: Private Placement to Fund Expansion</h4>
					<img src="images/monitor.jpg" alt="Medical equipment"><!--Photo by Anna Shvets from Pexels-->
					<p>The management of a publicly held company feared that its strategic expansion plan would founder on the securities laws. The plan called for the company to arrange financing for the lease and purchase of medical equipment and facilities via a private placement of securities. The company’s investment bankers advised, however, that to implement this plan, the company would have to register as a securities broker in a slew of jurisdictions. Such registration would have subjected the company to onerous, continuing regulation involving huge compliance costs and greatly increased exposure to litigation. The architect of the company’s plan— with the encouragement of the company’s general counsel—hurriedly requested my help.</p>
					<p>The Outcome: I devised a method whereby management could pursue almost all its strategic goals without registering as a broker, thus saving the company substantial compliance costs and significantly reducing its potential exposure to litigation.</p>

					<h4>Case 2: Securities Law Fraud Claim</h4>

					<p>Based on what turned out to be material misrepresentations, a too-trusting investor paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for preferred stock which he never received. The fraudsters responded to the claim of misrepresentation with defenses purportedly rooted in securities law. The entire burden of advancing these defenses fell to the fraudsters’ expert witness, an experienced securities law attorney. Counsel for the investor engaged me as his expert witness. At the deposition of the fraudsters’ expert witness, my expert consulting services dismantled the purported securities law defenses.</p>
					<p>The Outcome: On the eve of my deposition, the fraudsters offered to settle for 90 percent of what the investor sought, and the investor agreed to the settlement.</p>
